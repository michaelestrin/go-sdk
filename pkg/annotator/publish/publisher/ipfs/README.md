# InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) Publisher

The IPFS publisher publishes annotations to an [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) (IPFS) instance.  

To set up and configure a local IPFS instance to use with the [multistage example code](/cmd/examples/multistage/main.go), follow the [*Getting Started*](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/usage/) directions on the IPFS documentation site.   Note the URL for your locally installed IPFS instance; it is required when the publisher is instantiated.
